# Houses-Prices-prediction
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting house prices using a Linear Regression Model. The workflow involves data preprocessing, data visualization, model training, and evaluation.


# Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, and other relevant parameters. Using a linear model, this project demonstrates how to preprocess data, visualize important trends, split datasets for training and testing, and make predictions.
